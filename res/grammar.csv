Past Continuous,"<b>Past Continuous</b>

<b>1.</b>We form the Past Continuous in this way:
POSITIVE
I/he/she/it      <b>was</b>    <b>waiting.</b>
You/we/they  <b>were</b>  <b>waiting.</b>

NEGATIVE
I/he/she/it       <b>was not/wasn't</b>         <b>waiting.</b>
You/we/they   <b>were not/weren't y</b>   <b>waiting.</b>

QUESTIONS
<b>Was</b>     /he/she/it        <b>waiting?</b>
<b>Were</b>   you/we/they    <b>waiting?</b>

<b>2.</b> Look at this example:
I <b>was living</b> in Japan in 1991. (I lived there from 1990 to 1993.)
We use the Past Continuous for an action or situation that was in progress at a particular time in the past (e.g. <b>at 7 p.m., in 1991</b>).

<b>3.</b> 
When I<b> walked</b> into the room, Ann <b>was writing</b> postcards and Keith <b>was reading</b>.
We use the Past Simple (walked) for a completed action. We use the Past Continuous (was writing) for an action in progress in the past.

<b>4.</b>We can use <b>when</b> or <b>while</b> before the Past Continuous:
 I met her when/while we were working for the same company. (when = during the
time)
We can only use when (not while ) before the Past Simple:
When I met her, we were working for the same company. (when = at the time)"
