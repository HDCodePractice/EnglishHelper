Past Continuous,"<b>Past Continuous</b>

<b>1.</b>We form the Past Continuous in this way:
POSITIVE
I/he/she/it      <b>was</b>    <b>waiting.</b>
You/we/they  <b>were</b>  <b>waiting.</b>

NEGATIVE
I/he/she/it       <b>was not/wasn't</b>         <b>waiting.</b>
You/we/they   <b>were not/weren't y</b>   <b>waiting.</b>

QUESTIONS
<b>Was</b>     /he/she/it        <b>waiting?</b>
<b>Were</b>   you/we/they    <b>waiting?</b>

<b>2.</b> Look at this example:
I <b>was living</b> in Japan in 1991. (I lived there from 1990 to 1993.)
We use the Past Continuous for an action or situation that was in progress at a particular time in the past (e.g. <b>at 7 p.m., in 1991</b>).

<b>3.</b> 
When I<b> walked</b> into the room, Ann <b>was writing</b> postcards and Keith <b>was reading</b>.
We use the Past Simple (walked) for a completed action. We use the Past Continuous (was writing) for an action in progress in the past.

<b>4.</b>We can use <b>when</b> or <b>while</b> before the Past Continuous:
 I met her when/while we were working for the same company. (when = during the
time)
We can only use when (not while ) before the Past Simple:
When I met her, we were working for the same company. (when = at the time)"
Word order SVO,"1 Look at this table:

SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT
Our firm      makes       computers.
I                  posted       the letter.
She            caught       the train.
The phone doesn't work.
He              was eating  a sandwich.

Sentences must have a subject and a verb.If there is an object, it usually goes after the verb. Any other information, such as a time,a place etc, usually follows the object:

SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT + PLACE
She              met         Tom      in Rome.

(Not She met in Rome Tom.)

to find the SUBJECT and OBJECT, ask  What or Who.
Chen loves Mary.
Who loves Mary?
Whom does Chen love?

My dog loves my daughters. 
Who loves my daughters
Whom does my dog love?

2 We put an adjective before a noun:

            ARTICLE + ADJECTIVE + NOUN
She has   a             blue                dress.

We put an adjective after be, get, and seem:

            VERB     + ADJECTIVE
She     is            clever.
He      seems     nice.

3 We usually put a place before a time:

                      + PLACE          + TIME
He worked     in a factory        for a year.
They've been here                   since 2.
We met          in France           last Tune.
I walked        around the town yesterday.

4 We usually put a direction before a time:
                         + DIRECTION   + TIME
The bus arrived from Liverpool at 10.30.
He came            to this country in 1985.
