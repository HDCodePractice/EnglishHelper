    "description": "Past Simple (I walked, she rang)\n\n1 We form the Past Simple of regular verbs by adding <b>-ed</b> to the verb:\nwalk→walked\nwatch→watched\nopen→opened\nask→asked\n\nThere are some exceptions:\n* verbs ending with -e:\n+ -d:  live→lived like→liked\nverbs ending with a consonant and -y:\n-y→-ied: apply→applied try→tried\nmost verbs ending with one vowel and one consonant:\n-P→-pped: stop→stopped\nplan→planned\n\n2The Past Simple form of many verbs is\nirregular:\ndo→did\nhave→had\ntake→took\nbuy→bought\ncome→came\nstand→stood\nfind→found\nring→rang\ngo→went\nsay→said\n\n3 We form the negative with didn't and the infinitive (e.g. do, take, understand):\nI didn't understand. (Not didn't understood)\nWe form questions with did and the infinitive (e.g. watch):\nDid you watch the film?\n\n4 The Past Simple of be is like this:\nI/he/she/it     was/wasn't    very good.\nYou/we/they were/weren't very good.\n\nWas     I/he/she/it    very good?\nWere   you/we/they very good?\n\n5 We use the Past Simple to talk about a completed event in the past. We often say when it happened (e.g. yesterday, last night):\nChris phoned me yesterday. He wanted to discuss something with me.\nDid you enjoy the concert last night?\n\n6 We can use the Past Simple with for to talk about something that continued for a period of time, and ended in the past:\nI lived in Rome for two years.

    "description": "<b>Past Continuous</b>\n\n<b>1.</b>We form the Past Continuous in this way:\nPOSITIVE\nI/he/she/it      <b>was</b>    <b>waiting.</b>\nYou/we/they  <b>were</b>  <b>waiting.</b>\n\nNEGATIVE\nI/he/she/it       <b>was not/wasn't</b>         <b>waiting.</b>\nYou/we/they   <b>were not/weren't y</b>   <b>waiting.</b>\n\nQUESTIONS\n<b>Was</b>     /he/she/it        <b>waiting?</b>\n<b>Were</b>   you/we/they    <b>waiting?</b>\n\n<b>2.</b> Look at this example:\nI <b>was living</b> in Japan in 1991. (I lived there from 1990 to 1993.)\nWe use the Past Continuous for an action or situation that was in progress at a particular time in the past (e.g. <b>at 7 p.m., in 1991</b>).\n\n<b>3.</b> \nWhen I<b> walked</b> into the room, Ann <b>was writing</b> postcards and Keith <b>was reading</b>.\nWe use the Past Simple (walked) for a completed action. We use the Past Continuous (was writing) for an action in progress in the past.\n\n<b>4.</b>We can use <b>when</b> or <b>while</b> before the Past Continuous:\n I met her when/while we were working for the same company. (when = during the\ntime)\nWe can only use when (not while ) before the Past Simple:\nWhen I met her, we were working for the same company. (when = at the time)"
